## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for interactivity
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For stylesheet organization and variables

### Continued development

I think it's important to know about all the events happening among the listeners, as many of them will make things easier for you.

### AI Collaboration

I used GitHub Copilot as a learning partner throughout this project to deepen my understanding of JavaScript event handling, CSS layout techniques, and debugging strategies.

**What I used it for:**

- **Debugging**: When features weren't working as expected, I used Copilot to help me understand _why_ something wasn't functioning rather than just getting a quick fix. This taught me how to think systematically about problems.
- **Concept exploration**: I asked questions about how events work in JavaScript.
- **Problem-solving approach**: Instead of providing complete solutions, Copilot helped me develop debugging instincts—learning to use DevTools, console.log strategically, and isolate issues.

**What worked well:**

- Having explanations of the "why" behind concepts made the learning stick better than just copying code.
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller pieces made them feel manageable.
- Getting feedback on my approach before implementing helped me avoid dead ends.

**What I learned:**

- AI tools are most valuable when used for understanding, not just getting answers. Struggling through problems (with guidance) builds real skills.
- Learning to ask specific questions about your code leads to better help.
- The best projects come from genuine problem-solving, not from AI-generated solutions.
